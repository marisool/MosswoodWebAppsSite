#Welcome, Mosswood Students!#
##This is our class website##
###In case you forgot how to get the latest copy of the site, here's a small guide:###
1. Make sure you're on Chrome.  Both Firefox and Internet Explorer have been loading the github site incorrectly, and we haven't gotten it working in our computer lab.
2. Go to YOUR OWN REPOSITORY for this site (if you don't have one already, click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page).
3. Click the "Pull Request" button near the top of your repo's page.

Pull requests have a funny name, because the "pulling" can actually go in any direction:

1. You can request that I pull changes you've made.
2. You can request to pull changes that I've made.

On the Pull Request screen, you pick two repositories, and request a pull between them.  Generally, you can freely pull changes to your own repos, and you have to wait for someone to add changes you've made to their own repos.

Look at the little arrow between the two repo selectors, and make sure the arrow points at your repo, and you select my repo with the other menu.

If your repo is not up to date, it will provide an area to write a message to accompany your request, and then a big request button.  From there it will attempt to automatically merge the changes.  Not all changes merge automatically!  If it can be automatic, look for the big "Merge Automatically" button.  Otherwise, you'll have to go through some of the files and look for weird symbols, like this:

	>>>>>>>>>>>>452987dfjk298dk18xfmk81kfh

Those symbols usually sandwich sections of code that have "merge conflicts", or areas where you've both edited the same amount of code.  They basically let you sort out which parts you want to keep, then delete the little attention-getting garbage lines, and then you're free to complete the merge by creating a new "commit", or just proceeding to make your changes, and then pushing them to your repo again.

###Remember:  Send me your changes!###
I won't always notice when you have made cool changes to the site, so after you've done your commits for the day, send me a pull request, so I can merge your changes into the main repo.

##Happy Coding!##
